   abstract = {Introduction: Since the year 2000, IDF has been measuring the prevalence of diabetes nationally, regionally and globally. Aim: To produce estimates of the global burden of diabetes and its impact for 2017 and projections for 2045. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify published studies on the prevalence of diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycaemia in pregnancy in the period from 1990 to 2016. The highest quality studies on diabetes prevalence were selected for each country. A logistic regression model was used to generate age-specific prevalence estimates or each country. Estimates for countries without data were extrapolated from similar countries. Results: It was estimated that in 2017 there are 451 million (age 18–99 years) people with diabetes worldwide. These figures were expected to increase to 693 million) by 2045. It was estimated that almost half of all people (49.7%) living with diabetes are undiagnosed. Moreover, there was an estimated 374 million people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and it was projected that almost 21.3 million live births to women were affected by some form of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. In 2017, approximately 5 million deaths worldwide were attributable to diabetes in the 20–99 years age range. The global healthcare expenditure on people with diabetes was estimated to be USD 850 billion in 2017. Conclusion: The new estimates of diabetes prevalence, deaths attributable to diabetes and healthcare expenditure due to diabetes present a large social, financial and health system burden across the world.},

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline and Embase between January 2000 and December 2019, studies published in English and conducted on humans. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Observational studies investigating progression to T2DM. Inclusion criteria were postpartum follow-up for at least 12 months, incident physician based diagnosis of diabetes, T2DM reported as a separate outcome rather than combined with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, and studies with both a group of patients with GDM and a control group. RESULTS This meta-analysis of 20 studies assessed a total of 1 332 373 individuals (67 956 women with GDM and 1 264 417 controls). Data were pooled by random effects meta-analysis models, and heterogeneity was assessed by use of the I 2 statistic. The pooled relative risk for the incidence of T2DM between participants with GDM and controls was estimated. Reasons for heterogeneity between studies were investigated by prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and, overall, studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias (P=0.58 and P=0.90). The overall relative risk for T2DM was almost 10 times higher in women with previous GDM than in healthy controls (9.51, 95% confidence interval 7.14 to 12.67, P<0.001). In populations of women with previous GDM, the cumulative incidence of T2DM was 16.46% (95% confidence interval 16.16% to 16.77%) in women of mixed ethnicity, 15.58% (13.30% to 17.86%) in a predominantly non-white population, and 9.91% (9.39% to 10.42%) in a white population. These differences were not statistically significant between subgroups (white v mixed populations, P=0.26; white v non-white populations, P=0.54). Meta-regression analyses showed that the study effect size was not significantly associated with mean study age, body mass index, publication year, and length of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Women with a history of GDM appear to have a nearly 10-fold higher risk of developing T2DM than those with a normoglycaemic pregnancy. The magnitude of this risk highlights the importance of intervening to prevent the onset of T2DM, particularly in the early years after pregnancy.},

   abstract = {Background &objectives: Women with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of being diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, but the postpartum screening rate is low. To provide evidence-based data for health providers and promote postpartum screening, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to access the risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in different demographic and maternal subgroups. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched systematically. Unadjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95 per cent confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochrane’s Q text and by calculating I2 values. Subgroup analyses were conducted to address the disparities of type 2 diabetes conversion after gestational diabetes in different demographic and maternal subgroups. Results: 1809 publications were screened and 39 cohort studies including 2,847,596 women were selected. In these studies, 78,893 women were diagnosed as T2DM at six weeks or later after delivery. The unadjusted RRs of women diagnosed T2DM at six weeks or later after delivery ranged from 1.32 (95% CI, 0.46-3.37) to 47.25 (95% CI, 2.95-758.01) with a pooled unadjusted RR of 8.92 (95% CI, 7.84-10.14). Older women, women with a family history of diabetes, Black and non-Hispanic White women and women living in Europe and South-East Asia had a higher risk of developing T2DM after GDM. Interpretation & conclusions: It is suggested that healthcare providers may focus on older women with GDM and women with GDM and a family history of diabetes. Black and non-Hispanic White women with GDM may receive more attention, and healthcare providers, especially those in Europe and South-East Asia, may pay more attention to preventive measures for postpartum T2DM.},

   abstract = {CONTRIBUTION What are the novel findings of this work? Echocardiographic evaluation of fetal heart function shows that maternal diabetes is associated with functional impairment, not only in pregestational but also in gesta-tional diabetes. The results of a meta-analysis of multiple functional sonographic markers support these findings. What are the clinical implications of this work? Current routine evaluation of structural heart abnormalities may not be sufficient to comprehend fully the effects of maternal diabetes on fetal cardiac development and function. Functional impairment detected by ultrasound should be further evaluated in relation to immediate perinatal outcome and long-term offspring cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT Objective Maternal diabetes in pregnancy is associated with structural anomalies of the fetal heart, as well as hypertrophy and functional impairment. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effect of maternal diabetes on fetal cardiac function as measured by prenatal echocardiography. Methods We performed a search of the EMBASE, PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases, from inception to 4 July 2019, for studies evaluating fetal cardiac function using echocardiography in pregnancies affected by diabetes compared with uncomplicated pregnancies. Outcome measures were cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic, systolic and overall cardiac function as assessed by various ultrasound parameters. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data on interventricular septal (IVS) thickness, myocardial performance index (MPI) and E/A ratio were pooled for the meta-analysis using random-effects models. For pregnancies with diabetes, results were reported overall and according to whether diabetes was pregesta-tional (PDM) or gestational (GDM). Results were also stratified according to the trimester in which fetal cardiac assessment was performed. Results Thirty-nine studies were included, comprising data for 2276 controls and 1925 women with pregnancy affected by diabetes mellitus (DM). Of these, 1120 had GDM, 671 had PDM and in 134 cases diabetes type was not specified. Fetal cardiac hypertrophy was more prevalent in diabetic pregnancies than in non-diabetic controls in 21/26 studies, and impaired diastolic function was observed in diabetic pregnancies in 22/28 studies. The association between DM and systolic function was inconsistent, with 10/25 studies reporting no difference between cases and controls, although more recent studies measuring cardiac deformation, i.e. strain, did show decreased systolic function in diabetic pregnancies. Of the studies measuring overall fetal cardiac function, the majority (14/21) found significant impairment in diabetic pregnancies. Results were similar when stratified according to GDM or PDM. These effects were already present in the first trimester, but were most profound in the third trimester. Meta-analysis of studies performed in the third trimester showed, compared with controls, increased IVS thickness in both PDM (mean difference, 0.75 mm (95% CI, 0.56-0.94 mm)) and GDM 540 Depla et al. (mean difference, 0.65 mm (95% CI, 0.39-0.91 mm)) pregnancies, decreased E/A ratio in PDM pregnancies (mean difference,-0.09 (95% CI,-0.15 to-0.03)), no difference in E/A ratio in GDM pregnancies (mean difference,-0.01 (95% CI,-0.02 to 0.01)) and no difference in MPI in either PDM (mean difference, 0.04 (95% CI,-0.01 to 0.09)) or GDM (mean difference, 0.03 (95% CI,-0.01 to 0.06)) pregnancies. Conclusions The findings of this review show that maternal diabetes is associated with fetal cardiac hypertro-phy, diastolic dysfunction and overall impaired myocar-dial performance on prenatal ultrasound, irrespective of whether diabetes is pregestational or gestational. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the relationship with long-term outcomes.},

   abstract = {AIMS We estimated the number of live births worldwide and by IDF Region who developed hyperglycaemia in pregnancy in 2013, including total diabetes in pregnancy (known and previously undiagnosed diabetes) and gestational diabetes. METHODS Studies reporting prevalence of hyperglycaemia first-detected in pregnancy (formerly termed gestational diabetes) were identified using PubMed and through a review of cited literature. A simple scoring system was developed to characterise studies on diagnostic criteria, year study was conducted, study design, and representation. The highest scoring studies by country with sufficient detail on methodology for characterisation and reporting at least three age-groups were selected for inclusion. Forty-seven studies from 34 countries were used to calculate age-specific prevalence of hyperglycaemia first-detected in pregnancy in women 20-49 years. Adjustments were then made to account for heterogeneity in screening method and blood glucose diagnostic threshold in studies and also to align with recently published diagnostic criteria as defined by the WHO for hyperglycaemia first detected in pregnancy. Prevalence rates were applied to fertility and population estimates to determine regional and global prevalence of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy for 2013. An estimate of the proportion of cases of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy due to total diabetes in pregnancy was calculated using age- and sex-specific estimates of diabetes from the IDF Diabetes Atlas and applied to age-specific fertility rates. RESULTS The global prevalence of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy in women (20-49 years) is 16.9%, or 21.4 million live births in 2013. An estimated 16.0% of those cases may be due to total diabetes in pregnancy. The highest prevalence was found in the South-East Asia Region at 25.0% compared with 10.4% in the North America and Caribbean Region. More than 90% of cases of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy are estimated to occur in low- and middle-income countries. CONCLUSION These are the first global estimates of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy and conform to the new WHO recommendations regarding diagnosis and also include estimates of live births in women with known diabetes. They indicate the importance of the disease from a public health and maternal and child health perspective, particularly in developing countries.},
