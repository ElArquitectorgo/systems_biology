   abstract = {Introduction: Since the year 2000, IDF has been measuring the prevalence of diabetes nationally, regionally and globally. Aim: To produce estimates of the global burden of diabetes and its impact for 2017 and projections for 2045. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify published studies on the prevalence of diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycaemia in pregnancy in the period from 1990 to 2016. The highest quality studies on diabetes prevalence were selected for each country. A logistic regression model was used to generate age-specific prevalence estimates or each country. Estimates for countries without data were extrapolated from similar countries. Results: It was estimated that in 2017 there are 451 million (age 18–99 years) people with diabetes worldwide. These figures were expected to increase to 693 million) by 2045. It was estimated that almost half of all people (49.7%) living with diabetes are undiagnosed. Moreover, there was an estimated 374 million people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and it was projected that almost 21.3 million live births to women were affected by some form of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. In 2017, approximately 5 million deaths worldwide were attributable to diabetes in the 20–99 years age range. The global healthcare expenditure on people with diabetes was estimated to be USD 850 billion in 2017. Conclusion: The new estimates of diabetes prevalence, deaths attributable to diabetes and healthcare expenditure due to diabetes present a large social, financial and health system burden across the world.},

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline and Embase between January 2000 and December 2019, studies published in English and conducted on humans. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Observational studies investigating progression to T2DM. Inclusion criteria were postpartum follow-up for at least 12 months, incident physician based diagnosis of diabetes, T2DM reported as a separate outcome rather than combined with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, and studies with both a group of patients with GDM and a control group. RESULTS This meta-analysis of 20 studies assessed a total of 1 332 373 individuals (67 956 women with GDM and 1 264 417 controls). Data were pooled by random effects meta-analysis models, and heterogeneity was assessed by use of the I 2 statistic. The pooled relative risk for the incidence of T2DM between participants with GDM and controls was estimated. Reasons for heterogeneity between studies were investigated by prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and, overall, studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias (P=0.58 and P=0.90). The overall relative risk for T2DM was almost 10 times higher in women with previous GDM than in healthy controls (9.51, 95% confidence interval 7.14 to 12.67, P<0.001). In populations of women with previous GDM, the cumulative incidence of T2DM was 16.46% (95% confidence interval 16.16% to 16.77%) in women of mixed ethnicity, 15.58% (13.30% to 17.86%) in a predominantly non-white population, and 9.91% (9.39% to 10.42%) in a white population. These differences were not statistically significant between subgroups (white v mixed populations, P=0.26; white v non-white populations, P=0.54). Meta-regression analyses showed that the study effect size was not significantly associated with mean study age, body mass index, publication year, and length of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Women with a history of GDM appear to have a nearly 10-fold higher risk of developing T2DM than those with a normoglycaemic pregnancy. The magnitude of this risk highlights the importance of intervening to prevent the onset of T2DM, particularly in the early years after pregnancy.},

   abstract = {Background &objectives: Women with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of being diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, but the postpartum screening rate is low. To provide evidence-based data for health providers and promote postpartum screening, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to access the risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in different demographic and maternal subgroups. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched systematically. Unadjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95 per cent confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochrane’s Q text and by calculating I2 values. Subgroup analyses were conducted to address the disparities of type 2 diabetes conversion after gestational diabetes in different demographic and maternal subgroups. Results: 1809 publications were screened and 39 cohort studies including 2,847,596 women were selected. In these studies, 78,893 women were diagnosed as T2DM at six weeks or later after delivery. The unadjusted RRs of women diagnosed T2DM at six weeks or later after delivery ranged from 1.32 (95% CI, 0.46-3.37) to 47.25 (95% CI, 2.95-758.01) with a pooled unadjusted RR of 8.92 (95% CI, 7.84-10.14). Older women, women with a family history of diabetes, Black and non-Hispanic White women and women living in Europe and South-East Asia had a higher risk of developing T2DM after GDM. Interpretation & conclusions: It is suggested that healthcare providers may focus on older women with GDM and women with GDM and a family history of diabetes. Black and non-Hispanic White women with GDM may receive more attention, and healthcare providers, especially those in Europe and South-East Asia, may pay more attention to preventive measures for postpartum T2DM.},

   abstract = {CONTRIBUTION What are the novel findings of this work? Echocardiographic evaluation of fetal heart function shows that maternal diabetes is associated with functional impairment, not only in pregestational but also in gesta-tional diabetes. The results of a meta-analysis of multiple functional sonographic markers support these findings. What are the clinical implications of this work? Current routine evaluation of structural heart abnormalities may not be sufficient to comprehend fully the effects of maternal diabetes on fetal cardiac development and function. Functional impairment detected by ultrasound should be further evaluated in relation to immediate perinatal outcome and long-term offspring cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT Objective Maternal diabetes in pregnancy is associated with structural anomalies of the fetal heart, as well as hypertrophy and functional impairment. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effect of maternal diabetes on fetal cardiac function as measured by prenatal echocardiography. Methods We performed a search of the EMBASE, PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases, from inception to 4 July 2019, for studies evaluating fetal cardiac function using echocardiography in pregnancies affected by diabetes compared with uncomplicated pregnancies. Outcome measures were cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic, systolic and overall cardiac function as assessed by various ultrasound parameters. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data on interventricular septal (IVS) thickness, myocardial performance index (MPI) and E/A ratio were pooled for the meta-analysis using random-effects models. For pregnancies with diabetes, results were reported overall and according to whether diabetes was pregesta-tional (PDM) or gestational (GDM). Results were also stratified according to the trimester in which fetal cardiac assessment was performed. Results Thirty-nine studies were included, comprising data for 2276 controls and 1925 women with pregnancy affected by diabetes mellitus (DM). Of these, 1120 had GDM, 671 had PDM and in 134 cases diabetes type was not specified. Fetal cardiac hypertrophy was more prevalent in diabetic pregnancies than in non-diabetic controls in 21/26 studies, and impaired diastolic function was observed in diabetic pregnancies in 22/28 studies. The association between DM and systolic function was inconsistent, with 10/25 studies reporting no difference between cases and controls, although more recent studies measuring cardiac deformation, i.e. strain, did show decreased systolic function in diabetic pregnancies. Of the studies measuring overall fetal cardiac function, the majority (14/21) found significant impairment in diabetic pregnancies. Results were similar when stratified according to GDM or PDM. These effects were already present in the first trimester, but were most profound in the third trimester. Meta-analysis of studies performed in the third trimester showed, compared with controls, increased IVS thickness in both PDM (mean difference, 0.75 mm (95% CI, 0.56-0.94 mm)) and GDM 540 Depla et al. (mean difference, 0.65 mm (95% CI, 0.39-0.91 mm)) pregnancies, decreased E/A ratio in PDM pregnancies (mean difference,-0.09 (95% CI,-0.15 to-0.03)), no difference in E/A ratio in GDM pregnancies (mean difference,-0.01 (95% CI,-0.02 to 0.01)) and no difference in MPI in either PDM (mean difference, 0.04 (95% CI,-0.01 to 0.09)) or GDM (mean difference, 0.03 (95% CI,-0.01 to 0.06)) pregnancies. Conclusions The findings of this review show that maternal diabetes is associated with fetal cardiac hypertro-phy, diastolic dysfunction and overall impaired myocar-dial performance on prenatal ultrasound, irrespective of whether diabetes is pregestational or gestational. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the relationship with long-term outcomes.},

   abstract = {AIMS We estimated the number of live births worldwide and by IDF Region who developed hyperglycaemia in pregnancy in 2013, including total diabetes in pregnancy (known and previously undiagnosed diabetes) and gestational diabetes. METHODS Studies reporting prevalence of hyperglycaemia first-detected in pregnancy (formerly termed gestational diabetes) were identified using PubMed and through a review of cited literature. A simple scoring system was developed to characterise studies on diagnostic criteria, year study was conducted, study design, and representation. The highest scoring studies by country with sufficient detail on methodology for characterisation and reporting at least three age-groups were selected for inclusion. Forty-seven studies from 34 countries were used to calculate age-specific prevalence of hyperglycaemia first-detected in pregnancy in women 20-49 years. Adjustments were then made to account for heterogeneity in screening method and blood glucose diagnostic threshold in studies and also to align with recently published diagnostic criteria as defined by the WHO for hyperglycaemia first detected in pregnancy. Prevalence rates were applied to fertility and population estimates to determine regional and global prevalence of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy for 2013. An estimate of the proportion of cases of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy due to total diabetes in pregnancy was calculated using age- and sex-specific estimates of diabetes from the IDF Diabetes Atlas and applied to age-specific fertility rates. RESULTS The global prevalence of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy in women (20-49 years) is 16.9%, or 21.4 million live births in 2013. An estimated 16.0% of those cases may be due to total diabetes in pregnancy. The highest prevalence was found in the South-East Asia Region at 25.0% compared with 10.4% in the North America and Caribbean Region. More than 90% of cases of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy are estimated to occur in low- and middle-income countries. CONCLUSION These are the first global estimates of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy and conform to the new WHO recommendations regarding diagnosis and also include estimates of live births in women with known diabetes. They indicate the importance of the disease from a public health and maternal and child health perspective, particularly in developing countries.},

	abstract = {Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic complication of pregnancy, with a prevalence that has increased significantly in the last decade, coming to affect 12–18% of all pregnancies. GDM is believed to be the result of a combination of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Following the identification of susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes by means of genome-wide association studies, an association has also been demonstrated between some type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes and GDM, suggesting a partial similarity of the genetic architecture behind the two forms of diabetes. More recent genome-wide association studies, focusing on maternal metabolism during pregnancy, have demonstrated an overlap in the genes associated with metabolic traits in gravid and non-gravid populations, as well as in genes apparently unique to pregnancy. Epigenetic changes—such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNA gene silencing—have also been identified in GDM patients. Metabolomics has been used to profile the metabolic state of women during pregnancy, based on the measurement of numerous low-molecular-weight metabolites. Measuring amino acids and conventional metabolites has revealed changes in pregnant women with a higher insulin resistance and high blood glucose levels that resemble the changes seen in non-gravid, insulin-resistant populations. This would suggest similarities in the metabolic profiles typical of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia whether individuals are pregnant or not. Future studies combining data obtained using multiple technologies will enable an integrated systems biology approach to maternal metabolism during a pregnancy complicated by GDM. This review highlights the recent knowledge on the impact of genetics and epigenetics in the pathophysiology of GDM and the maternal and fetal complications associated with this pathology condition.},

	abstract = {Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a serious pregnancy complication, in which women without previously diagnosed diabetes develop chronic hyperglycemia during gestation. In most cases, this hyperglycemia is the result of impaired glucose tolerance due to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction on a background of chronic insulin resistance. Risk factors for GDM include overweight and obesity, advanced maternal age, and a family history or any form of diabetes. Consequences of GDM include increased risk of maternal cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and macrosomia and birth complications in the infant. There is also a longer-term risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in the child. GDM affects approximately 16.5% of pregnancies worldwide, and this number is set to increase with the escalating obesity epidemic. While several management strategies exist—including insulin and lifestyle interventions—there is not yet a cure or an efficacious prevention strategy. One reason for this is that the molecular mechanisms underlying GDM are poorly defined. This review discusses what is known about the pathophysiology of GDM, and where there are gaps in the literature that warrant further exploration.},

Compared to the carrier of the combined CT + TT genotypes of the GNB3 rs5443 polymorphism, triglyceride was significantly higher for the carrier of CC genotype in the complete sample population (128.2 ± 93.2 vs. 114.3 ± 79.1 mg/dl; P = 0.041). In addition, the carriers of CC variant had a higher total cholesterol than those with the combined CT + TT variants (194.5 ± 36.8 vs. 187.9 ± 33.0 mg/dl; P = 0.019) in the complete sample population. In the normal controls, both triglyceride (P = 0.018) and total cholesterol (P = 0.011) were also significantly higher in the CC homozygotes than in the combined CT + TT genotypes. However, the GNB3 rs5443 SNP did not exhibit any significant association with obesity or overweight among the subjects.

Materials and methods: This research was conducted among women who visited the third-affiliate hospital of Zhengzhou University for pregnancy checkups from 1 June 2014 to 30 December 2014. Based on the results of a 75-g glucose tolerance test (OGTT), 140 pregnant women with GDM were randomly selected as a part of the GDM group and140 healthy, pregnant women as part of the control group. Relevant clinical and laboratory data for the child and the mother including her pregnancy outcomes and the delivery mode were collected for the epidemiological survey. Results: The results showed that risk factors for GDM are advanced age, the hepatitis B virus, family history of diabetes, high body mass index before pregnancy, and weight gain of ≥10 kg before 24-week gestation. We found that diet structures were severely unbalanced. The polymorphisms rs2241766 and rs5443 were found to potentially be associated with GDM; moreover, a positive interaction was demonstrated between rs2241766 and age, and a negative interaction was demonstrated with weight gain of ≥10 kg before 24-week gestation. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that both environmental risk factors and genetic background contribute to the development of GDM.},

In this study, clinicopathological data with a carrier of a variant allele of both KCNJ11 and KCNQ1 genes were also analysed, and a significant association was found between the carrier of a variant allele with gender and PPG in KCNJ11 and with triglyceride in KCNQ1. We confirm the significant association of KCNJ11 (rs5210) and KCNQ1 (rs2237895) gene polymorphism with T2DM, indicating the role of these variants in developing risk for T2DM in Indian population.},

The pancreatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K (K-ATP) channel is a key regulator of insulin secretion. Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) subunits of the channel cause neonatal diabetes.

The insulin lispro dilution allowed administration of the exact insulin doses, obtaining a good glycemic control andminimizing the burden of injections. At 2months, corrected age insulin doses were progressively decreased until discontinuation.},

	abstract = {Objective: Recent genetic studies have shown that potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member1 (KCNQ1) gene is related to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, studies for the rs2237892 polymorphism in KCNQ1 and GDM remain conflicting in Asians. Furthermore, associations of this polymorphism with glucose levels during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) have not been described in Chinese pregnant women. The present study aimed to provide evidence for the associations of rs2237892 in KCNQ1 with GDM and glucose levels, and to systematically evaluate the effect of rs2237892 on GDM in Asians. Methods: A case-control study on 562 women with GDM and 453 controls was conducted in Beijing, China. The association of rs2237892 with risk of GDM was analyzed using logistic regression. The associations with quantitative glucose levels were assessed using linear regression models. A meta-analysis including the present case-control study and four previously published reports in Asians was conducted. Results: The rs2237892 polymorphism in KCNQ1 was associated with GDM (OR (95%CI) =1.99 (1.26-3.15)). Additionally, the polymorphism was associated with levels of 1h and 2h glucose during OGTT. The pre-pregnancy BMI, age and genotypes of KCNQ1 polymorphism were independent risk factors of GDM. Subsequently, we performed a meta-analysis in Asians. In total, C-allele carriers of rs2237892 polymorphism had a 50% higher risk for GDM (OR (95%CI) =1.50(1.15-1.78)). Conclusion: The study demonstrated for the first time that the KCNQ1 rs2237892 polymorphism was associated with GDM and glucose levels in Chinese women. The study provides systematic evidence for the association between this polymorphism and GDM in Asians.},

To determine the role of the intrauterine diabetic environment per se, the prevalence of diabetes and the mean BMI were compared in siblings born before and after their mother was recognized as having diabetes. Nuclear families in which at least one sibling was born before and one after the mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were selected. Consequently, the siblings born before and after differed in their exposure to diabetes in utero. A total of 58 siblings from 19 families in which at least one sibling had diabetes were examined at similar ages (within 3 years). The risk of diabetes was significantly higher in siblings born after the mother developed diabetes than in those born before the mother's diagnosis of diabetes (odds ratio 3.7, P = 0.02). In 52 families, among 183 siblings without diabetes, the mean BMI was 2.6 kg/m2 higher in offspring of diabetic than in offspring of nondiabetic pregnancies (P = 0.003). In contrast, there were no significant differences in risk of diabetes or BMI between offspring born before and after the father was diagnosed with diabetes. Intrauterine exposure to diabetes per se conveys a high risk for the development of diabetes and obesity in offspring in excess of risk attributable to genetic factors alone.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal was to describe the temporal pattern of neonatal plasma glucose levels and associations with maternal glucose levels, cord serum C-peptide levels, and neonatal size and adiposity. METHODS: A total of 17 094 mothers and infants were included in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study (15 centers in 9 countries). Mothers underwent a 75-g, 2-hour, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24 to 32 weeks of gestation. Cord blood and neonatal blood samples were collected. Biochemical neonatal hypoglycemia was defined as glucose levels of <10th percentile (2.2 mmol/L). Clinically identified hypoglycemia was ascertained through medical record review and associations were assessed. RESULTS: Plasma glucose concentrations were stable during the first 5 hours after birth. Maternal glucose levels were weakly positively associated with biochemical neonatal hypoglycemia (odds ratios: 1.07-1.14 for 1-SD higher OGTT glucose levels). Frequency of neonatal hypoglycemia was higher with higher cord C-peptide levels (odds ratio: 11.6 for highest versus lowest C-peptide category). Larger and/or fatter infants were more likely to have hypoglycemia (P < .001), and infants with hypoglycemia tended to have a higher frequency of cord C-peptide levels of >90th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: Mean neonatal plasma glucose concentrations varied little in the first 5 hours after birth, which suggests normal postnatal adjustment. Biochemical and clinical hypoglycemia were weakly related to maternal OGTT glucose measurements but were strongly associated with elevated cord serum C-peptide levels. Larger and/or fatter infants were more likely to develop hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. These relationships suggest physiologic relationships between maternal glycemia and fetal insulin production. Copyright © 2010 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.},

We aimed to investigate the association of free T4(fT4) levels with insulin requirement in pregnant women with GDM. We included pregnant women whose TSH levels were within the normal range and who were diagnosed with GDM, and excluded patients with thyroid dysfunction, chronic illnesses, or any previous history of antithyroid medication, levothyroxine, or antidiabetic medication use. The diagnosis and treatment of GDM were based on American Diabetes Association guidelines. Demographic features, previous history of GDM and gestational hypertension were recorded. Baseline (at diagnosis of GDM) fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, TSH, fT4, and fT3 levels were analyzed. We grouped the patients according to their baseline fT4 levels: isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia (IMH) (group A) vs. in the normal range (group B). We grouped those also based on insulin requirement in 3rd trimester. Of the patients (n=223), insulin requirement was present in 56, and IMH in 11. Insulin requirement was more frequent in group A than in group B (p=0,003). HbA1c (≥47,5 mmol/mol) and fT4 level (lower than normal range) were positive predictors for insulin requirement (OR:35,35, p=0,001; and OR:6,05, p=0,008; respectively). We showed that IMH was closely associated with insulin requirement in GDM. Pregnant women with IMH and GDM should be closely observed as regards to glycemic control.

We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate whether hypothyroidism in pregnancy is associated with gestational diabetes risk. Materials and methods: Published literature from PubMed and EMBASE were searched for eligible publications. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a fixed- or random-effects model. Results: Seven articles described the relationship between hypothyroidism and risk of gestational diabetes. This meta-analysis revealed that overt hypothyroidism was associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (OR 1.892, 95% CI 1.679-2.132, p < 0.001). The relative risk of gestational diabetes was also increased in subclinical hypothyroidism, with the OR of 1.558 (95% CI 1.292-1.877, p < 0.001). There was no evidence of significant association between hypothyroxinemia and risk of gestational diabetes (OR 1.394, 95% CI 0.753-2.580, p = 0.291). The OR for all of the hypothyroidism was 1.749 (95% CI 1.586-1.928, p < 0.001), and an association was found.

Obese women are predisposed to pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and children of obese mothers are more likely to develop cardiovascular and metabolic disease in later life. Maternal obesity and GDM may be associated with a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation termed "metainflammation", as opposed to an acute inflammatory response. This inflammatory environment may be one mechanism by which offspring of obese women are programmed to develop adult disorders. Methods Herein we review the evidence that maternal obesity and GDM are associated with changes in the maternal, fetal and placental inflammatory profile. Results Maternal inflammation in obesity and GDM may not always be associated with fetal inflammation. Conclusion We propose that the placenta 'senses' and adapts to the maternal inflammatory environment, and plays a central role as both a target and producer of inflammatory mediators. In this manner, maternal obesity and GDM may indirectly program the fetus for later disease by influencing placental function.},

	abstract = {Gestational diabetes (GDM) is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy. Although it is a well-known cause of pregnancy complications, its epidemiology has not been studied systematically. Our aim was to review the recent data on the epidemiology of GDM, and to describe the close relationship of GDM to prediabetic states, in addition to the risk of future deterioration in insulin resistance and development of overt Type 2 diabetes. We found that differences in screening programmes and diagnostic criteria make it difficult to compare frequencies of GDM among various populations. Nevertheless, ethnicity has been proven to be an independent risk factor for GDM, which varies in prevalence in direct proportion to the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in a given population or ethnic group. There are several identifiable predisposing factors for GDM, and in the absence of risk factors, the incidence of GDM is low. Therefore, some authors suggest that selective screening may be cost-effective. Importantly, women with an early diagnosis of GDM, in the first half of pregnancy, represent a high-risk subgroup, with an increased incidence of obstetric complications, recurrent GDM in subsequent pregnancies, and future development of Type 2 diabetes. Other factors that place women with GDM at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes are obesity and need for insulin for glycaemic control. Furthermore, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and afterwards may be more prevalent in women with GDM. We conclude that the epidemiological data suggest an association between several high-risk prediabetic states, GDM, and Type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is suggested as a pathogenic linkage. It is possible that improving insulin sensitivity with diet, exercise and drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of diabetes in individuals at high risk, such as women with polycystic ovary syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, and a history of GDM. Large controlled studies are needed to clarify this issue and to develop appropriate diabetic prevention strategies that address the potentially modifiable risk factors.},

Pregnancy is a period of unique metabolic plasticity, during which mild insulin resistance is a physiological adaptation to prioritize fetal growth. To compensate for this, the pancreatic β-cell utilizes a variety of adaptive mechanisms, including increasing mass, number and insulin-secretory capacity to maintain glucose homeostasis. When insufficient insulin production does not overcome insulin resistance, hyperglycemia can occur. Changes in the maternal system that occur in GDM such as lipotoxicity, inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as impairments in adipokine and placental signalling, are associated with impaired β-cell adaptation.

Kinetic studies in human pregnancy have shown that fluxes of energy-yielding substrates, i.e. glucose, fatty acids and glycerol, increase in parallel with the increasing demands of the fetus and the mother. Resistance to insulin action, measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, appears early in gestation and is correlated with the infant's birth weight. Adaptive responses in nitrogen metabolism, decreased plasma urea concentration and decreased rate of urea synthesis, are apparent early in pregnancy, much before any significant increase in fetal demands. Recent studies of branched chain aminoacid (leucine) kinetics show a lower flux of leucine nitrogen and an unchanged flux of leucine carbon in gestation. A linear correlation between rate of deamination of leucine and rate of urea synthesis was observed in pregnant women. It is speculated that decreased anaplerotic carbon flux in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as a consequence of insulin resistance, may have an important role in the down-regulation of transamination of leucine during pregnancy, and may contribute to the conservation and accretion of nitrogen by the mother and the fetus. © 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

Several risk factors have been related to GDM; one of the most important among them is genetic predisposition. Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that act at different levels on various tissues, could cause changes in the expression levels and activity of proteins, which result in glucose and insulin metabolism dysfunction. In this review, we describe various SNPs; which according to literature, increase the risk of developing GDM. These SNPs include: (1) those associated with transcription factors that regulate insulin production and excretion, such as rs7903146 (TCF7L2) and rs5015480 (HHEX); (2) others that cause a decrease in protective hormones against insulin resistance such as rs2241766 (ADIPOQ) and rs6257 (SHBG); (3) SNPs that cause modifications in membrane proteins, generating dysfunction in insulin signaling or cell transport in the case of rs5443 (GNB3) and rs2237892 (KCNQ1); (4) those associated with enzymes such as rs225014 (DIO2) and rs9939609 (FTO) which cause an impaired metabolism, resulting in an insulin resistance state; and (5) other polymorphisms, those are associated with growth factors such as rs2146323 (VEGFA) and rs755622 (MIF) which could cause changes in the expression levels of these proteins, producing endothelial dysfunction and an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, characteristic on GDM.

	abstract = {The many functional partnerships and interactions that occur between proteins are at the core of cellular processing and their systematic characterization helps to provide context in molecular systems biology. However, known and predicted interactions are scattered over multiple resources, and the available data exhibit notable differences in terms of quality and completeness. The STRING database (http://string-db.org) aims to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) associations. The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.},

	abstract = {A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web-and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

@article{Dong2023,
	abstract = {The Bourne-again shell (Bash) is a prevalent scripting language for orchestrating shell commands and managing resources in Unix-like environments. It is one of the mainstream shell dialects that is available on most GNU Linux systems. However, the unique syntax and semantics of Bash could easily lead to unintended behaviors if carelessly used. Prior studies primarily focused on improving the reliability of Bash scripts or facilitating writing Bash scripts; there is yet no empirical study on the characteristics of Bash programs written in reality, e.g., frequently used language features, common code smells, and bugs. In this article, we perform a large-scale empirical study of Bash usage, based on analyses over one million open source Bash scripts found in Github repositories. We identify and discuss which features and utilities of Bash are most often used. Using static analysis, we find that Bash scripts are often error-prone, and the error-proneness has a moderately positive correlation with the size of the scripts. We also find that the most common problem areas concern quoting, resource management, command options, permissions, and error handling. We envision that these findings can be beneficial for learning Bash and future research that aims to improve shell and command-line productivity and reliability.},

@article{Mering2005,
	abstract = {A full description of a protein's function requires knowledge of all partner proteins with which it specifically associates. From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently, information about protein association is scattered over a wide variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein-protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING integrates and ranks these associations by bench-marking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable. STRING currently holds 730 000 proteins in 180 fully sequenced organisms, and is available at http://string. embl.de/. © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.},
